## What is HashBLD?

HashBLD provides a set of build scripts to build Hashlink targeting
gaming platforms. The goal is to provide a out-of-box usable
[Hashlink](https://hashlink.haxe.org/) with minimal dependencies. It
should be executable on a clean target platform without development
tools or SDK installed, eliminating unexpected link error or unsatisfied
DLL issue.

The first set of target platforms include:

- Linux
  - Linux desktop
  - Steam runtime (Steam Deck)
- macOS (including tools for codesign and notarization
- Windows Desktop

More platforms may be added when I expand my gaming plan to more
platforms.
